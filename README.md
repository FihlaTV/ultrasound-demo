# Ultrasound-demo

Inter-device communication under airplane mode demo. Made for my [Hack Club](https://wootton.hackclub.com) recruiting season 2019-2020.

This demo is a simple wrapper of the library [quiet.js](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js). Major code came from the [demos](https://github.com/quiet/quiet-js/tree/master/examples/text) of the library.

This demo is designed to work under situations without a stable internet connection. I have no idea why I wrote the express routes instead of running a simple server with three folders, yet here I am. It took me about 30 minutes to get this whole thing working, so roast lightly on the code ðŸ’–
